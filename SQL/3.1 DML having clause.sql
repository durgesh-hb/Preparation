select * from students;

--Example 1: Using the WHERE Clause--

select * from students
where stu_fees<3000;

--Example 2: Using the GROUP BY Clause--

select stu_class, sum(stu_fees) as total_fees
from students
group by stu_class;

select stu_class, sum(stu_fees) as tt
from students
group by stu_class;

--#more group by examples
--#write a query to find the total number of students in each class.
select stu_class, count(stu_name) as total_stu

--#Write a query to count how many students are 
--#there in each subject where age is greater than 15.

select stu_subject, count(stu_name >15) as total

--Example 3: Using the ORDER BY Clause--

select from student
oredr by stu_age asc --or desc

--Example 4: Using the HAVING Clause--

#having 

select city, count(*) as nnnn
from employee
group by city
having count(EmpName) > 3;
-- Show cities having more than 3 employees

select department, count(EmpName) as total_emp_in_depart 
from employee
group by department
having count(EmpName) > 3;
-- Show departments having more than 3 employees


#display city where total salary > 200000

select city, sum(salary) as totoalcsalary
from employee 
group by city 
having totoalcsalary > 200000;
-- Show cities where total salary is greater than 200000


# Show departments where average salary is greater than 60000
select department, avg(salary) as vv
from employee
group by department
having vv > 60000;
-- Departments with average salary greater than 60000


# Display cities where minimum salary is less than 30000
select city, min(salary) as ss
from employee
group by city 
having ss < 30000;
-- Cities where minimum salary is less than 30000


# show dept having exactly 3 employees
select department, count(EmpName) as qq
from employee
group by department
having qq = 3;
-- Departments having exactly 3 employees


select * from employee;
-- Display all employee records

truncate employee;
-- Remove all records from employee table (structure remains)

update employee set department = "IA"
where EmpID = 1;
-- Update department of employee with EmpID = 1

START TRANSACTION;
-- Start a new transaction

delete from employee 
where EmpId = 1;
-- Delete employee with EmpID = 1

rollback;
-- Undo the delete operation if not committed
--Example 5: Using the LIMIT Clause--

SELECT stu_name, stu_fees
FROM Students
ORDER BY stu_fees DESC
LIMIT 3;

--Example 6: Using the FROM Clause--

select stu_class
from students;

--Example 7: Using the LIKE Operator--

--The LIKE operator is used within a WHERE clause to search for
--a specified pattern in a column. It is typically used with wildcards such as:

"%" : matches zero or more characters
"_" : matches a single character

SELECT stu_name, stu_subject FROM 
Students_Table WHERE stu_name LIKE '%Patil';
Output:

stu_name            stu_subject
Divyesha Patil      Maths

--Example 8: Using the AND Operator--

--The AND logical operator combines multiple conditions 
--in a WHERE clause, and a record is only included if all conditions are true.

Query:

SELECT stu_name, stu_class, stu_age 
FROM Students_Table WHERE stu_class = 9 AND stu_age = 16;

--Example 8: Using the OR Operator--

--The OR clause is used to combine multiple conditions
--where at least one must be true. It is useful when searching for multiple criteria,
--such as retrieving customers from either New York or Los Angeles.
