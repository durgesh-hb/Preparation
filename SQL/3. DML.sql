#DML commands is used to mangage and modify the data inside a table
# * It does not chnage the table structure
# * It only works with the data (row/records)

#Generally, DML commands fall into one of four primary categories:
-- 1) INSERT - adds fresh data to a table.
-- 2) UPDATE - Change the data that is already in a table.
-- 3) DELETE - takes a record out of a table.
-- 4) SELECT - Get information out of one or more tables.
